    "question": "Do Casper mattresses sleep hot?",
    "answer": "Our mattresses are specifically designed to sleep cool. We run thermal imaging tests and sweat tests to make sure our mattresses feel nice and breezy throughout the night to keep you comfortable.<br></br> The Casper has AirScapeTM, our innovative cooling system that uses perforated breathable foam to help reduce heat and tiny holes to move hot air and body heat away. <br></br>If you get hot at night, the Wave Hybrid Snow mattress might be your best bet. It has a cool-to-the-touch feeling thanks to a CoolTouch Cover, plus HeatDelete Bands™ (graphite cooling bands) that constantly pull heat away from underneath the body for sustained temperature regulation. Combined with our breathable AirScapeTM, foam layers, you’ll stay cool and comfortable from the moment you lay down until the moment you wake up."

    "question": "What should I do with my old mattress when I buy a new one?",
    "answer": "If your old mattress is on the way out but you're not sure what to do with it, we've got some ideas! Did you know that your old mattress can be recycled? Before disposing of your mattress, look into your state's policies for mattress removal, as that will be the most environmentally friendly option. If you are not able to recycle it, consider donating it to a local charitable organization so that your mattress can go to someone in need. <br><br/> Other options include reselling it, repurposing it, or throwing it away responsibly. Mattress removal is also available as part of our In-Home Delivery and Setup service."
